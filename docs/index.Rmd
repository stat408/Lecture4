# Course Goals (Debugging)

With this class, we cannot cover every possible situation that you will encounter. The goals are to:

1. Give you a broad range of tools that can be employed to manipulate, visualize, and analyze data, and
2. teach you to find help when you or your code "gets stuck".


## Process for writing code

When writing code (and conducting statistical analyses) an iterative approach is a good strategy.

1. Test each line of code as you write it and if necessary confirm that nested functions are giving the desired results.
2. Start simple and then add more complexity.

## Debugging Overview

> Finding your bug is a process of confirming the many things that you believe are true -- until you find one which is not true. 
- Norm Matloff

## Debugging Guide 
We will first focus on debugging when an error, or warning is tripped.

1. Realize you have a bug (if error or warning, read the message)
2. Make it repeatable
3. Identify the problematic line (using print statements can be helpful)
4. Fix it and test it (evaluate nested functions if necessary)

## Warnings vs. Errors

R will flag, print out a message, in two cases: warnings and errors.

 - What is the difference between the two?
 - Is the R process treated differently for errors and warnings?
 
## Warnings vs. Errors

- Fatal errors are signaled with `stop()` and force all execution of code to stop triggering an `error`.
- Warnings are generated with `warning()` and display potential problems. Warnings **do not** stop code from executing.
- Messages can also be passed using `message()`, which pass along information.


## Bugs without warning/error

In other cases, we will have bugs in our code that don't necessarily give a warning or an error.

- How do we identify these bugs?
- How can we exit a case where:
    - R is running and may be stuck?
    - the code won't execute because of misaligned parenthesis, braces, brackets?

Note: `NA` values often return a warning message, but not always.



# Operators in R
- Most mathematical operators are self explanatory, but here are a few more important operators.
    - `==` will test for equality. For example to determine if pi equals three, this can be evaluated with `pi == 3` in R and will return `r pi == 3 `. Note this operator returns a logical value.
    - `&` is the AND operator, so `TRUE & FALSE` will return `r TRUE & FALSE`.
    - `|` is the OR operator, so `TRUE | FALSE` will return `r TRUE | FALSE`.
    - `!` is the NOT operator, so `! TRUE` will return `r  ! TRUE`.
    - `^` permits power terms, so `4 ^ 2` returns `r 4^2` and `4 ^ .5` returns `r 4 ^ .5`.


## Exercise: Order of operations
Note that order of operations is important in writing R code.
```{r opt,eval=F}
4 - 2 ^ 2
(4 - 2) ^ 2
5 * 2 - 3 ^ 2
pi == 3
! TRUE & pi == 3
! (TRUE | FALSE) 
```

Evaluate all  expressions. Note `!` is R's not operator.

## Solution: Order of operations
The results of the R code are:
```{r opt2, }
4 - 2 ^ 2
(4 - 2) ^ 2
5 * 2 - 3 ^ 2
```

## Solution: Order of operations
The results of the R code are:
```{r }
pi == 3
! TRUE & pi == 3
! (TRUE | FALSE) 
```

# Data Wrangling

## Data Wrangling
As a statistician or more generally a data scientist the ability to manipulate, process, clean, and merge datasets is an essential skill. 

- These skills are generally referred to as data wrangling.
- In a data analysis or visualization setting, they will undoubtedly require a majority of your time.
- Wrangling data can be a painful process.
- This lecture will provide some tools and example of organizing data.

## Data Wrangling Concepts

- Wide and thin datasets
- Merging and joining relational data
- Dealing with strings (_later_)
- Dealing with date/time objects (_later_)


# Tidy Data

## Rules for Tidy Data
The concept of tidy data can be attributed to Hadley Wickham and has three principles for organizing data. [Tidy Data Reference](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf)

1. Each variable must have its own column,
2. Each observation must have its own row, and
3. Each value must have its own cell.

## Tidy Data Visual

## Why use Tidy Data

*Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way. - Hadley Wickham*

- Storing data in a consistent way gives familiarity with methods for manipulating data.
- Tidy data structure takes advantage of vectorised operations in R
- Many useful packages: such as `dplyr` and `ggplot2` require tidy data.



# Merge / Join

## Merge
An important skill is merging or combining data sets.

Consider the two data frames, how can we merge them and what should be the dimensions of the merged data frame.
```{r, echo = FALSE}
school_locations <- data.frame(school = c('MSU','VT','Mines'),
            state= c('MT', 'VA', 'CO'), stringsAsFactors = F)
kable(school_locations)
school_pop <- data.frame(school = c('Mines','MSU','VT'),
            enrollment = c(5794, 15688, 30598), stringsAsFactors = F)
kable(school_pop)
```

## pre-sort
One possibility is to use the arrange the data frames first and combine. Note: not generally advised.

```{r}
school_locations <- school_locations[order(school_locations$school),]
school_pop <- school_pop[order(school_pop$school),]
```

## pre-sort
One possibility is to use the arrange the data frames first and combine. Note: not generally advised.

```{r}
school_locations 
school_pop 
```


## rbind() and cbind()

Now, given that the data frames are both sorted the same way, we can bind the rows together.

```{r}
comb_df <- cbind(school_locations, school_pop)
comb_df
comb_df <- comb_df[,-3]
```

## rbind() and cbind()
Now assume we want to add another school to the data frame.

```{r, error=TRUE}
new_school <- c('Luther', 'IA',2337)
rbind(comb_df, new_school)
```
Note: if your strings are saved as factors, this chunk of code will give you an error.

## bind_rows() / bind_cols()

`dplyr` also contains functions for binding rows and columns.

## Exercise

Now combine the following information into a single table sorted alphabetically by the name of the ski hill.
```{r, echo = F}
ski_acres <- data.frame( ski.hill = c('Big Sky','Bridger Bowl', 'Jackson', 'Steamboat' ), 
                        skiable.acres = c(5800,2000, "2500+",2965))
kable(ski_acres)

df_cost <- data.frame( ski.resort = c('Bridger Bowl', 'Big Sky', 'Steamboat', 'Jackson'), 
                       ticket.cost = c(60, 'depends', 145, 130))
df_cost
disco <- data.frame(ski.hill = 'Discovery', skiable.acres = "2200", ticket.cost = "20"); disco
```

## Solution 1: bind_cols()

Now combine the following information into a single table sorted alphabetically by the name of the ski hill.
```{r, echo = F}
ski_acres |>
  bind_cols(df_cost) |> 
  select(-ski.resort) |>
  bind_rows(disco) |>
  arrange(ski.hill) |>
  kable()
```


## Solution 1: bind_cols()

```{r, eval = F}
ski_acres |>
  bind_cols(df_cost) |> 
  select(-ski.resort) |>
  bind_rows(disco) |>
  arrange(ski.hill) |>
  kable()
```


## Better Option: join()
We could have also used some of the more advanced merge (join) features from dplyr.

```{r}
school_df <- full_join(school_locations, school_pop, by='school')
school_df
```

## more about join

The dplyr join command includes the following options:

- left join
- right join
- inner join
- full join
- anti join

## Exercise

Combine the data sets
```{r,echo = F}
ski_acres
df_cost
disco_df <- tibble(ski.hill = 'Discovery', skiable.acres = '2200', ticket.cost = '20'); disco_df
```

## Better Solution

```{r, }

full_join(ski_acres, df_cost, by = c("ski.hill"= "ski.resort")) |>
  full_join(disco, by = join_by(ski.hill, skiable.acres, ticket.cost)) |>
  arrange(ski.hill)
```


# wide / long data

## Hoops Data

This is a _wide_ dataset

```{r, message = F}
hoops <- read_csv('http://www.math.montana.edu/ahoegh/teaching/stat408/datasets/TourneyDetailedResults.csv')
head(hoops)
```

## Plot Creation
Consider a plot where the number of points is colored or faceted by winning or losing. 

This requires a dataset that  is _thin_ and looks something like

|      Game Id     | Points |win/lose | 
|:----------------:|-------|:---------:|
| 1 | 92   | win       |
| 1   | 84   | lose       |
| 2  | 80   | win       |
| 2 | 51    | lose      |

## Data Wrangling

```{r}
lose_score <- hoops |> select(score = Lscore) |>
  mutate(outcome = 'lose', game_id = row_number()) 
win_score <- hoops |> select(score = Wscore) |> 
  mutate(outcome = 'win', game_id = row_number())
thin_scores <- bind_rows(win_score, lose_score) |> 
  arrange(game_id)
thin_scores
```


## Plot Creation

```{r, echo = F, message = F}
thin_scores %>% ggplot(aes(x = score)) + geom_histogram() + facet_wrap(.~outcome) +
  ggtitle('Points scored in NCAA games for Winning and Losing Teams')
```

## tidyr package

The `tidyr` package contains additional tools for converting files from long to wide formats.

Consider the `billboard` dataset which contains the rank of the song (in 2000) for each week after it first entered the list.

```{r}
billboard
```

## billboard data

If we want to identify songs that reach number 1 quickly, the data needs to manipulated.
```{r}
billboard_thin <- billboard |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("wk"), 
    names_to = "week", 
    values_to = "rank",
  values_drop_na = T
  )
billboard_thin
```

## Billboard Data Exercise

1. Determine which song in this dataset spent the most time at #1
2. How many different artists showed up on the billboard list?
3. Which artists had the most different songs on the billboard list?
4. Which track was on the most lists?

## 1. Solution

```{r}
billboard_thin |>
  filter(rank == 1) |>
  group_by(artist, track) |> 
  tally() |>
  ungroup() |>
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  slice(1) |>
  kable()
```

## 2. Solution

```{r}
billboard_thin |>
  group_by(artist) |>
  tally() |>
  tally()
```

## 3. Solution

```{r}
billboard_thin |>
  group_by(artist, track) |>
  slice(1) |>
  ungroup() |>
  group_by(artist) |>
  tally() |>
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  slice(1)
```

## 4. Solution

```{r}
billboard_thin |>
  group_by(track, artist) |>
  tally() |> arrange(desc(n))
```



## pivot_wider()

The `pivot_wider()` function allows transformation in the other direction from thin to wide.
